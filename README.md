## Overview  
<hr>  
This repo explores algorithms that can help identify optimum paths.  Initially, I will include only population as my optimizing criteria but I will continue to add features for improving the calculation such as minimum distance between cities or total cities visited per trip.  Initially I will only calculate the routes based on a crude method (search of all options) but I intend to use more optimized methods like Dijkstra's Algorithm in the future.

## Status  
1.  Currently have a basic model working
1.  Simple Dijkstra examples are working but customizations are in progress.
